To perform extraction:
1) Run run_dbextract.sh. An output CSV file will be created and the commands to generate SPSS syntax files will be output to the screen.
2) Run the commands displayed to create the syntax files.
3) Load the CSV file in LibreOffice and save in XLSX format. This will simplify importing the data into SPSS (due to accents and other issues...).
4) Load the XLSX file in SPSS.
5) Load and execute the syntax files created at step 2.
6) Save to extraction.sav.
